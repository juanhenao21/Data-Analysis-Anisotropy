# Data-Analysis-Anisotropy
Data Analysis of Superficial Anisotropy Simulations of Thin Films.
The data is obtained from Monte Carlo Simulations of thin films.
With the data are obtained magnetization curves, critical temperatures values and projections in the Z axis.
In this specific example, the data is obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation, with 

* Simple Cubic structure
* Initial Temperature = 422 K
* Final Temperature = 0 K
* Temperature step = -2 K
* Monte Carlo Steps = 50.000
* Exchange J = -11
* Radius cut = 3.0
* seed = 11, 13, 17, 19, 23
